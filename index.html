	<h2> Me </h2>
	<p>
	I'm a senior student, majoring in Business Analytics and Information systems at the University of Iowa. I come from Beijing China where I grew up and lived for 18 years. 
	I collect playing card since I was 15. It was the first time to saw a magic show and I was attracted by the card trick. I really believed there was some magic on the cards, so I started to collect the cards.
	Then I found out it's all about hand tricks, so I started to practice magic tricks. There are a part of my collection.
